Paws::Glacier::DeleteArchive - Arguments for method DeleteArchive on Paws::Glacier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeleteArchive on the 
Amazon Glacier service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DeleteArchive.

You shouln't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DeleteArchive.

As an example:

  $service_obj->DeleteArchive(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

single aposC<->apos (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS
account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If
you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens (apos-apos) in the
ID.
