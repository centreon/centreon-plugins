=head1 NAME

Paws::EC2::DescribeInternetGateways - Arguments for method DescribeInternetGateways on Paws::EC2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeInternetGateways on the 
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeInternetGateways.

You shouln't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeInternetGateways.

As an example:

  $service_obj->DescribeInternetGateways(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 DryRun => Bool

  

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action,
without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If
you have the required permissions, the error response is
C<DryRunOperation>. Otherwise, it is C<UnauthorizedOperation>.










=head2 Filters => ArrayRef[Paws::EC2::Filter]

  

One or more filters.

=over

=item *

C<attachment.state> - The current state of the attachment between the
gateway and the VPC (C<available>). Present only if a VPC is attached.

=item *

C<attachment.vpc-id> - The ID of an attached VPC.

=item *

C<internet-gateway-id> - The ID of the Internet gateway.

=item *

C<tag>:I<key>=I<value> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to
the resource.

=item *

C<tag-key> - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
independent of the C<tag-value> filter. For example, if you use both
the filter "tag-key=Purpose" and the filter "tag-value=X", you get any
resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the
tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key
is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the
C<tag>:I<key>=I<value> filter.

=item *

C<tag-value> - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter
is independent of the C<tag-key> filter.

=back










=head2 InternetGatewayIds => ArrayRef[Str]

  

One or more Internet gateway IDs.

Default: Describes all your Internet gateways.
