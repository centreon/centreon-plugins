=head1 NAME

Paws::EC2::DescribeVpcClassicLink - Arguments for method DescribeVpcClassicLink on Paws::EC2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeVpcClassicLink on the 
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeVpcClassicLink.

You shouln't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeVpcClassicLink.

As an example:

  $service_obj->DescribeVpcClassicLink(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 DryRun => Bool

  

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action,
without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If
you have the required permissions, the error response is
C<DryRunOperation>. Otherwise, it is C<UnauthorizedOperation>.










=head2 Filters => ArrayRef[Paws::EC2::Filter]

  

One or more filters.

=over

=item *

C<is-classic-link-enabled> - Whether the VPC is enabled for ClassicLink
(C<true> | C<false>).

=item *

C<tag>:I<key>=I<value> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to
the resource.

=item *

C<tag-key> - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
independent of the C<tag-value> filter. For example, if you use both
the filter "tag-key=Purpose" and the filter "tag-value=X", you get any
resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the
tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key
is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the
C<tag>:I<key>=I<value> filter.

=item *

C<tag-value> - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter
is independent of the C<tag-key> filter.

=back










=head2 VpcIds => ArrayRef[Str]

  

One or more VPCs for which you want to describe the ClassicLink status.
