=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudWatch::GetMetricStatistics - Arguments for method GetMetricStatistics on Paws::CloudWatch

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method GetMetricStatistics on the 
Amazon CloudWatch service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method GetMetricStatistics.

You shouln't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to GetMetricStatistics.

As an example:

  $service_obj->GetMetricStatistics(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 Dimensions => ArrayRef[Paws::CloudWatch::Dimension]

  

A list of dimensions describing qualities of the metric.










=head2 B<REQUIRED> EndTime => Str

  

The time stamp to use for determining the last datapoint to return. The
value specified is exclusive; results will include datapoints up to the
time stamp specified.










=head2 B<REQUIRED> MetricName => Str

  

The name of the metric, with or without spaces.










=head2 B<REQUIRED> Namespace => Str

  

The namespace of the metric, with or without spaces.










=head2 B<REQUIRED> Period => Int

  

The granularity, in seconds, of the returned datapoints. C<Period> must
be at least 60 seconds and must be a multiple of 60. The default value
is 60.










=head2 B<REQUIRED> StartTime => Str

  

The time stamp to use for determining the first datapoint to return.
The value specified is inclusive; results include datapoints with the
time stamp specified.










=head2 B<REQUIRED> Statistics => ArrayRef[Str]

  

The metric statistics to return. For information about specific
statistics returned by GetMetricStatistics, go to Statistics in the
I<Amazon CloudWatch Developer Guide>.

Valid Values: C<Average | Sum | SampleCount | Maximum | Minimum>










=head2 Unit => Str

  

The unit for the metric.
